# tstack babysit-pr (Grok Bot)

Source: https://github.com/t3dotgg/tstack (skill `babysit-pr`). The watcher in this repo is `.cursor/skills/tstack-babysit-pr/scripts/pr-wait`.

## MenuBarMijia merge gate (overrides tstack Greptile default)

Ready means all of:
- Required CI check runs on the current head are green (skipped OK).
- Codex (`chatgpt-codex-connector`) reviewed the **current** tip with no unresolved objections. If Codex has not reviewed this tip, comment `@codex review` once and wait. Do not `@codex` again if a review on this tip already exists.
- No merge conflicts; rebase when BEHIND/DIRTY, then re-wait.

Do **not** wait for Greptile or Macroscope unless the repo actually uses them.

## Waiting

Never write your own sleep poller. Use one watcher per PR:

```bash
.cursor/skills/tstack-babysit-pr/scripts/pr-wait <pr> --repo jryang1997/MenuBarMijia --until codex
```

`--until codex` is the merge gate above in one watcher: it exits 0 with `codex-green` once required checks are green, Codex completed on the current head with no findings, no thread is unresolved and the branch is not BEHIND. It exits 1 naming the blocker (findings, unresolved threads, BEHIND, or `codex failed`, which means comment `@codex review` again). After every push, comment `@codex review` and start a new watcher.

pstack alternative: poteto-mode Babysit playbook. Prefer one watcher stack per PR.

## Reviews

Only act on checks/comments newer than the latest push. Verify bot findings against source. Fix real issues; dismiss false positives with a written reason. Comment tone: `.cursor/skills/tstack-leaving-pr-comments/SKILL.md`.

## Merge

Merge only under Jerry's standing Codex-first + CI-green rule, or an explicit full-send grant for that PR. Otherwise stop at merge-ready and report the PR URL. Stay quiet while waiting.
