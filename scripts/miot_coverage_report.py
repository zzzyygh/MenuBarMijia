"""Print the MIoT coverage baseline (#295) from Tests/Fixtures/miot_coverage_golden.json.

Both platform test suites assert that synthesis matches this file, so the report is the
current state of the code. Counts are per fixture spec (1-2 per device type), not per model,
so they are not comparable with the model-weighted estimates in docs/research.
"Unexposed" counts writable bool/enum/range properties the card never reads; a property it
reads without offering a control counts as exposed, so the figure is a lower bound.
