## Why Put Smart Home Control on Your Desktop?

When coding, writing, or in a meeting, you don't need to reach for your phone:

1. **Keep Your Hands on the Keyboard:** Press `⌥M` to summon the panel, type a name or pinyin initials (e.g. `sftd` for "Study Desk Lamp"), and hit `Return` to toggle. Open a device’s details and use the arrow keys to adjust brightness or AC temperature. No scrolling through nested room trees.
2. **Push-to-Talk, Release to Run:** Hold `⌥M` or the menu bar icon to speak your command, and release when you are done. Everyday commands like switching lights or setting the thermostat are interpreted by local parsing rules—no wake words, no sluggish voice chatter. Optional AI backends handle multi-step requests.
3. **Sync with Your Daily Work Rhythm:** Automatically turn off lights when you lock your Mac or step away. Trigger your focus lighting when plugging in an external display. All automation rules are disabled by default; you stay in full control of what triggers when.
4. **All Off, with Undo:** Hold "All Off" when it is time to call it a day. Plugs and robot vacuums stay on by default, and if you change your mind, the undo button brings your devices back.

---

## Feature Demos

Here are a few everyday actions in the macOS demo home. The interface shown is in Chinese.

### 1. Push-to-Talk Voice Control

No wake words needed. Hold the menu bar icon or global shortcut to speak, and see execution receipts right away (showing local millisecond execution or AI resolution).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme-v2/voice-ptt.gif" alt="macOS demo: hold the shortcut, speak, and switch the study lamp to moonlight mode" width="900">
</p>

### 2. Room All-Off with Safety Protection & Undo

Heading out or turning in? Hold "All Off" for 0.6 seconds to switch off participating devices in the current view. Plugs, robot vacuums, and cameras are left alone by default, and you can change that in settings. If you switch something off by mistake, tap Undo.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme-v2/undo-all-off.gif" alt="macOS demo: hold All Off, leave the plug on, and undo" width="900">
</p>

### 3. macOS Display & Lock-Screen Automation

Turn everyday desktop transitions into ambient triggers. Configure a rule to turn off lights when you lock your screen or put your Mac to sleep, and another for returning. Mac-only rules can also react to camera/microphone use, AC power and battery thresholds, the Wi-Fi network name, Focus mode, upcoming calendar meetings, and late-night use. All of them are off by default; Wi-Fi name, Focus status, and Calendar require system permission before their rules fire.

</p>

### 4. Climate Trends & Energy Metrics

Wondering whether the room is warmer than yesterday? On macOS, open a sensor to see its temperature and humidity trends over 24 hours or 7 days. For plugs that report energy readings, device details show today’s usage and settings show the last 7 days.

## Features & Platform Matrix

The macOS version is built natively in Swift 6, while the Windows 11 client is an independent implementation using Tauri v2 and TypeScript. Both share verified golden fixtures (`Tests/Fixtures/`) for protocol and intent matching, while respecting system platform differences.

| Feature Area | macOS Native (14+) | Windows 11 Tray | Details |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Mi Home Direct QR Connect** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Scan with Mi Home app; supports CN, SG, DE, US, and RU regional servers; loads homes you own plus homes shared with your account |
| **Home Assistant Integration** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Native WebSocket connection with `xiaomi_home` entity synthesis and physical-device grouping |
| **Keyboard Search & Control** | ✅ Supported | — Not yet | On macOS, search by device name or pinyin initials and use arrow keys to control devices |
| **Global Activation Hotkey** | ✅ `⌥M` (Customizable) | ✅ `Alt+M` (Customizable) | Windows 1.1.4 adds custom key recording with collision detection |
| **Voice Interaction** | ✅ Menu bar hold / Hotkey hold / Hands-free | ⚠️ Hands-free only | macOS supports native Speech frameworks; Windows uses WebView speech recognition |
| **Local Command Parsing** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Power, brightness, temp, fan speeds, and timers are parsed locally |
| **Optional AI Assistant** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Connect Jev, DeepSeek, Ollama, etc. "Ask me when unsure" is on by default; the exact threshold lives in advanced settings |
| **Proactive "For You" Suggestions** | ✅ Up to 4 chips | ✅ Up to 4 pills | Manual card actions train time-bucket and weekday/weekend habits with a 14-day decay half-life and next-action prediction (undo rolls them back; see [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-habit-ranking-algorithm.md)). Local picks appear immediately; a configured model refreshes the cache in the background. Homes with fewer executable actions show their actual count. |
| **GrokBall & Side Suggestions** | ✅ Native Canvas | ✅ Bundled SVG engine | Click the ball for up to four reversible device actions; click again or press Esc to collapse. On macOS, neutral expressions use a black ball with white eyes, dragging repositions it, and a 0.5-second hold starts voice input. Suggestions follow its side of the panel and adapt their rows near screen edges. Windows retains the fixed side attachment. Eyes follow the pointer, and Reduce Motion uses static expressions. Based on [TyCoding/grok-ball](https://github.com/TyCoding/grok-ball) (MIT). |
| **Quick Actions & Scenes Strip** | ✅ 3 actions | ✅ 4 actions | Toggle in Settings — "Show Quick Actions Strip" on macOS, "Show top quick actions bar" on Windows. macOS ships All Lights Off, Soft Night Light, and Sleep Climate Off; Windows ships All main lights on, Lights off for sleep, 25° cool, and Brighten lights. Home Assistant scenes are appended on both. On macOS, four or fewer pills stretch edge to edge and the rest scroll horizontally with a normal mouse wheel. |
| **All-Off & Instant Undo** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | A 0.6s hold confirms the action; plugs and vacuums are excluded by default; reversible actions show an undo banner for 10–15s |
| **Mac Event Automation** | ✅ Supported | — Not yet | Triggers on lock, sleep, wake, external displays, camera/microphone use, power/battery, Wi-Fi, Focus, Calendar, and late-night use (all Mac-only signals off by default) |
| **Apple Shortcuts (App Intents)** | ✅ Supported (4 actions) | — Not yet | Toggle Device, Run Scene, Voice Command, Query Room Climate |
| **URL Scheme Control** | ✅ Supported | — Not yet | `menumijia://toggle` calls require confirmation by default; direct control can be enabled in settings |
| **Sensor Trend Line Charts** | ✅ 24h / 7d trends | ⚠️ Real-time value only | macOS charts temperature or humidity over selectable periods; Windows shows current readings |
| **Smart Plug Energy Logs** | ✅ Supported | — No history yet | macOS counts changes in cumulative hardware readings; missing data is not estimated |
| **Mi Air Purifiers, Air Fresheners & Humidifiers** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Both platforms synthesize `air-purifier`, `air-fresh`, and `humidifier` specs: PM2.5, air quality, temp/humidity, filter life, and a 1–100% fan slider driving the favorite level |
| **Fridges & Kitchen Appliances** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Fridges expose per-chamber current/target temperature and modes (Manual, Smart, Holiday, Super Cool, Super Freeze). Kettles, water dispensers, cookers, air fryers, ovens, microwaves, and health pots show working status, temperature, and minutes remaining; models exposing `start-cook` / `pause` actions can be started and stopped |
| **Dehumidifiers, Blankets, Diffusers & Speakers** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Dehumidifiers become fan cards driven by their reported mode list plus their own temp/humidity reading, electric blankets become climate cards, aroma diffusers become switchable plugs, and speakers become media cards with volume, mute, play state, sleep mode, and TTS |
| **Locks & Presence Sensors** | ✅ Read-only cards | ✅ Read-only cards | Door locks report battery. A readable `door-state` or Home Assistant `lock` entity shows locked, unlocked, ajar, or jammed; otherwise the card says the lock status is unknown instead of “Guarding”. Motion/occupancy, contact, water-leak, illumination, and air-quality monitors synthesize as sensor cards. MIoT exposes no remote unlock, so locks stay status-only. Mi gateways, routers, and repeaters are filtered out as network infrastructure instead of showing up as unknown devices. |
| **Camera Live View** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Click a card for a pinned live window: macOS uses HLS / HA snapshots; Windows ships a private P2P bridge (bundled helpers, SD/HD/Ultra quality) |
| **Layout Editing Resize** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Edit mode shows an iOS Control Center-style corner arc handle on each card's bottom-right: drag out/in to step half ↔ full ↔ panel, or tap it to cycle sizes |
| **Visual Look** | ✅ One system look + 4 heights | ✅ Control Center design | macOS keeps system materials only: a device that is on takes the loudest surface its appearance allows — a bright platter in light mode, a lifted well one step above the off glass in dark mode — everything else stays quiet glass. |
| **Code Signing & Integrity** | ⚠️ Self-signed + Ed25519 updates | ⚠️ Unsigned package | macOS requires manual Gatekeeper approval; Windows shows SmartScreen prompt |

## Quick Start

### 1. Requirements & Installation

- **macOS:** macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later (Universal Binary: Apple Silicon & Intel).
- **Windows:** Windows 11 (64-bit).

#### Installing on macOS

**Method A: Homebrew Cask (Recommended)**
```bash
brew install --cask jryang1997/tap/menubarmijia
```
> If Homebrew asks to trust a new third-party tap, run `brew trust --cask jryang1997/tap/menubarmijia` first.

**Method B: Direct DMG Download**
Download the latest macOS DMG from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jryang1997/MenuBarMijia/releases/latest) and drag `MenuBarMijia.app` into your Applications folder.
> **About macOS Gatekeeper:**<br>
> This project is an independent open-source tool and is not enrolled in the paid Apple Developer Program (no Developer ID notarization). If Gatekeeper blocks initial launch, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **"Open Anyway"** for MenuBarMijia.

#### Installing on Windows 11

Download the latest Windows x64 `.exe` or `.msi` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jryang1997/MenuBarMijia/releases/latest).
> **About Windows SmartScreen:**<br>
> The Windows binary is not signed with an enterprise Authenticode certificate. If SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC", click **"More info" → "Run anyway"**. SHA-256 digests are published on each Release for manual verification.

### 2. Connect Your Devices

Click the menu bar icon to reveal the panel, then open Settings `⚙️`:



- **Option A: Mi Home Direct Cloud Connect (Recommended):**<br>
  Select "Mi Cloud Connect" in Settings. A QR code appears on screen. Scan it with the official Mi Home app on your phone to link your account. All your homes, rooms, and supported devices sync instantly. On macOS, you can click "Add Account" in Settings to sign in to multiple Xiaomi accounts across regions at once and merge their devices and homes in one panel (Windows currently supports a single signed-in account). When Xiaomi's login response declares a cookie expiry (or the server rejects an expired token), the panel warns 3 days before expiry and switches the menu-bar icon to `house.slash` once expired, offering a one-click in-panel QR re-scan without guessing a lifetime for undated sessions.
- **Option B: Home Assistant local connection:**<br>
  Select "Home Assistant" and enter your instance origin, such as `http://192.168.1.100:8123`, and Long-Lived Access Token. On Windows, save settings and approve the endpoint in the native dialog. The token stays in Windows Credential Manager. A rejected or failed connection never switches to demo. Windows supports the existing light, climate, fan, plug, fridge, vacuum, camera-control, and sensor card models, plus scenes and scripts. macOS-only device types and HA camera live streams are outside this Windows backend.<br>
  On macOS, connecting to a LAN address or `.local` host can be blocked by the system's local-network privacy gate. The panel says so explicitly ("Local network connection blocked by macOS") instead of showing a generic socket error. Grant MenuBarMijia permission under **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Local Network**; if it still fails, reinstall so the local app signature lines up.
- **Option C: Offline Demo Home:**<br>
  Explore the interface and controls without an account using simulated devices.

## Keyboard Shortcuts & Natural Commands

### Keyboard Navigation

These panel shortcuts apply to macOS. On Windows, the default shortcut to open the panel is `Alt+M`.

| Shortcut | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `⌥M` | Toggle the MenuBarMijia panel |
| Type letters | Instant search by device name, room, or pinyin initials (e.g. `sftd`) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate through search matches and device cards |
| `Return` / `Space` | Toggle the focused device; expand the detail drawer if not directly switchable |
| `→` / `←` | Press Right to open details; then use Left and Right to adjust light brightness, AC temperature, or volume |
| `Tab` | Switch between room tabs |
| `Esc` | Clear search query, close drawer, or dismiss panel |

### Local Natural Language Commands

These phrases are parsed locally **without any AI API key** or cloud model tokens:

- **Power:** "turn off study light", "turn on living room ac", "turn off all lights"
- **Lighting presets:** "study light moonlight mode", "daylight mode"
- **Adjustments:** "dimmer", "brighter", "set bedroom light to 40%"
- **Climate & Fan:** "set ac to 24 degrees", "warmer", "fan natural wind"
- **Timers:** "in 10 minutes turn off study light", "cancel timer"
- **Undo:** "undo", "revert" (active for 10 minutes after any batch execution)

## Safety, Privacy & Limitations

MenuBarMijia is an independent open-source project, not an official Xiaomi app. Mi Home cloud control needs an internet connection. You can connect your own Home Assistant instance on macOS or Windows.

### Where credentials live

| Secret | What is stored | Where |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Xiaomi Home / Mijia | Every signed-in account's `userId`, `cUserId`, `ssecurity`, `serviceToken`, cloud region and declared expiry | macOS Keychain (one generic-password item) or Windows Credential Manager |
| Home Assistant | The long-lived access token (the instance URL is not secret) | macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager |
| AI assistants | The API key saved for each provider, plus the imported-key source label and remembered cloud-consent endpoints | API keys in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager; the non-secret labels in app preferences |
| LG webOS TV | The pairing client key issued by the TV | macOS Keychain |

macOS encrypts these Keychain items at rest and protects them with the login Keychain; MenuBarMijia writes them with `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`, so they are available after the first unlock but are never synced to iCloud or another Mac. The app does not store these secrets in plain `UserDefaults` or log files. macOS may ask for Keychain permission after an app update because the build signature changes; answering "Always Allow" covers later reads and writes.

Versions up to 1.0.6 could mirror credentials into plain `UserDefaults`. On first launch after upgrading, each legacy plaintext value is written into the Keychain and the plaintext key is deleted only after that write succeeds. If the Keychain is unavailable, the old copy is left in place for the next attempt instead of silently pretending the migration succeeded.

### High-risk controls, lock screen, and revocation

Manual controls on high-risk devices ask for a second confirmation, not only AI-proposed actions: turning on a heater, switching a plug or camera, starting a vacuum, or turning a water heater on or hotter. Turning one of these off stays direct, so making the home safer never requires fighting a dialog. Door/window and gas-alarm sensors are read-only status cards in this app, so they cannot be actuated here at all. The confirmation table is shared with the AI policy and lives in `Sources/MijiaCore/ModelActionPolicy.swift`.

Settings → 隐私 / Privacy has **锁屏时禁止控制设备 / Block device control while locked**, on by default. While the Mac screen is locked, card/detail controls, `menumijia://` links, App Intents/Shortcuts and assistant commands are refused with a toast; scheduled commands and Mac-event automation rules still run. The toggle is persisted locally and the lock state comes from the system's screen-lock notifications.

The same Settings page has **退出并吊销令牌 / Sign Out & Revoke Tokens**, confirmed by a destructive dialog. It signs out every Xiaomi Home account, deletes the Home Assistant token and disconnects, and clears saved AI keys and cloud-consent records. Device names, room layout and local history stay. You can also revoke one thing at a time: 退出登录 in the Mi account section, replacing the HA token with an empty value, or the per-key 撤销 button in the AI settings.

On macOS the Home Assistant token only goes to an https address or a local-network endpoint without asking. For any other plain-http address (a public DDNS name, say) the panel first explains that the token would travel unencrypted and connects only after you choose 仍然连接 / Connect Anyway. The choice is remembered per address, a changed address asks again, and Sign Out & Revoke Tokens forgets every such choice.

Everyday commands are handled by local rules. You can also connect an AI service of your choice for more complex requests. The request includes your command, device and environment information, and any habit summary you have enabled. Manual card actions also train local time-bucket habit memories (used only for the "For You" suggestions); the habit learning toggle turns this off, learned entries can be reviewed and cleared, and undoing a banner rolls the matching records back. Speech recognition uses system services; on-device-only recognition is available for supported languages. Device, room and scene names are passed to the system speech service as recognition hints.

To help prevent mistakes, actions the AI is unsure about ask first ("Ask me when unsure" is on by default), and risky actions such as turning on a heater, switching a plug, or starting a vacuum always wait for your confirmation. URL controls also ask first by default, with an option to enable direct control.

The macOS app is not yet notarized by Apple, so you may need to allow it in System Settings the first time. Windows may show a SmartScreen prompt. macOS updates are verified with an Ed25519 public key; the signing key stays offline. See [ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-lan-direct-deferred.md) for more on connection options.

Each release also publishes GitHub build provenance attestations for the installers and SPDX SBOMs for both platforms. `gh attestation verify <installer> --repo jryang1997/MenuBarMijia` checks that the file was built by this repository's release workflow. See [verifying release artifacts](SECURITY.md#verifying-release-artifacts).

To report a vulnerability in private, follow [Security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Development & Architecture

- **Architecture:** The macOS version is written in pure Swift 6 with **no third-party Swift runtime dependencies**, adhering to strict concurrency rules. Core protocol handling and device synthesis live in `MijiaCore` with full headless test coverage. The Windows client is built with Tauri v2 (Rust + TypeScript + Vite).
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Both platforms run separate test suites against shared golden test fixtures in `Tests/Fixtures/` (intents, specs, regions, AI payloads) to prevent behavioral drift (see [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-dual-platform-implementation.md)).

### Local Build & Verification

```bash
# Run secret checks, linters, and Swift tests on macOS
bash scripts/check.sh

# Build, sign locally, and launch MenuBarMijia.app
bash scripts/build_app.sh

# Build and test the Windows tray app
cd windows
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```
